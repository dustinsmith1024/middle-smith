<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">J</span>ekyll is an awesome blogging tool that I read about a few month ago.  I played around with it a bit for creating Github pages, and thought it might be a nice replacement to my made from scratch CMS I was utilizing.  Turns out this was the case and Jekyll + Github is perfect for blogging...if your developer.</p>

I am still in progress of migrating my posts from my old Rails app to this Jekyll based Github backed blog.  However This has proven to be easy to set-up, extensible enough, and worthwhile to learn some new tech.

### Update

I have been using Middleman lately for static site generation. Seems to work a bit better with SASS/SCSS.
