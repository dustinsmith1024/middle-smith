<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">I</span> am switching roles at work soon and had to document everything I do for the next person.  I have no idea if the next person will be a web developer or not.  So I added a few links for them to use to my Getting Started doc.  I figure I should post them here as well.  Keep in mind I used Ruby, Rails, and some PHP for my old position.</p>

HTML

* Use to mark the layout of web documents
* [W3.org](http://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Training) or search google

CSS

* Use to style HTML documents
* [W3.org](http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Training)

JavaScript (ECMAScript)

* Used for dynamic parts on the web (Filters, Animations, Popups, AJAX)
* Lots of examples on the internet
* [Mozilla JS Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Guide)

jQuery and jQuery UI
* Framework for Javascript. Very popular, you can write your own JS if you like, but I prefer jQuery
<a href="http://jquery.com">jQuery</a>

Ruby
* [Ruby-Lang](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
* [Learn Ruby in 20 minutes](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)

Ruby on Rails
* A ruby web framework with Model View Controller (MVC) structure</li>
* Documents is great and web community is large. You can find examples of almost everything on google.
* [RubyonRails.org](http://rubyonrails.org/)

PHP
* PHP used the same way as ruby is. Good for simple quick web pages with integrated access to MySql.
* (Php.net)[http://www.php.net]
* Pretty good documentation with good examples in the comments


There are lots of bad web development examples on the internet. When developing try to learn the base languages then the frameworks after. When developing HTML documents try to use Progressive Enhancement to build the pages. This means creating a semantically correct HTML document first, then styling with CSS, and then building on interaction with JavaScript. Also make sure your code is validated by the correct doctype. I try to incorporate these principles into my websites.

Side note: I am moving on to be a Web Developer at Cerner. I will be working on an assortment of Personal Health type websites. Looks like most of the use Python and <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter01/">Django</a>.
