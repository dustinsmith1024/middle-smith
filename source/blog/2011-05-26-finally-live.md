<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">F</span>inally this site is up and running.  I have made a few different designs and never liked any of them. So finally on my 27th b-day at 5AM we are live!
</p>

I decided to skip Wordpress or Joomla or any other content management system and just roll my own with Rails, JQuery, and little HTML5/CSS3 for fun.  Since I don't get to at work, I really want to learn more about interacting with different Social API's.  So hopefully you'll find more and more integration with Twitter, Flickr and whatever else is next.

I have no clue how often I will post or what about.  My main reason for doing this is to play with new technologies and get some more design experience.

Hit me up on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/dsmith1024) if you have any feedback.
