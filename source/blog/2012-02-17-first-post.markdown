<p class="intro"><span class="first-letter">I</span> finally left Bluehost and switched my domains over to NameCheap.  I don't have a need for hosting other than Heroku/Github anymore.  I store all my personal work in a private repo and any fun or demo type stuff in public.  I like it much better than trying to manage a server and all that.</p>

I put the Heroku commands in a Gist for reference later on: [link](https://gist.github.com/1849509.js)
